* First-time launch help.
* Make it appear as "Pressletter" on Springboard.
* Detect when we've loaded a non-Letterpress image and say something nice...
* Word animation (when tapping on suggested word label)
* It'd be nice to offer to delete the screenshot. (Not sure we can do this...)

* Point evaluation and scoring. For each word we find, evaluate the score
  change using color info, then sort on *that*.

* Hit caching. It'd be great if we treated the 25-letter string of tile letters
  as a unique board identifier and cached all the hits as a text file.
